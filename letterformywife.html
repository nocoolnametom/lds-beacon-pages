                <blockquote class="mdl-typography--body-1">
                  In general it is true that nothing which cannot stand up under discussion and
                  criticism is worth defending.

            <h3>The Author's Story</h3>
              <p>
                The author is your typical LDS husband and father.  He was born in the convenant and
                served an honorable full-time mission.  After returning home, he married in the Temple
                and pretty much lived out the typical Mormon story.  In terms of his normality, his favorite
                food is teriyaki chicken.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2009 after the public fanfare alongside the release of the first volumes of the
                Joseph Smith Papers project, the author began researching LDS history with excitement.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, over time small issues began to appear in his researching.  The author listed
                his concerns and "put them on the shelf," to employ the popular metaphor.  Eventually,
                the weight of these unresolved and expanding issues led to the author needing to
                explain to his wife the issues he was facing along with the context of the
                issues in 2016.
              </p>
              <p>
                That letter formed the foundation of this document, which the author continues to update
                both with new information as well as resolving mistakes and errors brought to his
                attention.  Accuracy and facts are important, especially with a subject of such deep and
                potentially eternal impact.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2017, the unofficial LDS apologetic group FairMormon publicly released an
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href="https://www.fairmormon.org/answers/Criticism_of_Mormonism/Online_documents/For_my_Wife_and_Children_(Letter_to_my_Wife)"
                >
                  analysis
                </a>
                of <em>Letter For My Wife</em>.  As a measurement of the claims, FAIR declared that one-third of
                the claims they chose to examine were accurate, and that the remaining percentage was not
                false though still open to debate.  AS the author has pointed out, FAIR has not evaluated
                all of the letter, and the amount of the letter that FAIR has chosen to either uphold as
                accurate or not commented on is easily the majority of the letter.
